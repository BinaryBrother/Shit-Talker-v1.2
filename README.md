<h1>True Apps</h1>
<p>This project contains an old 16-bit program based on VB3/4, called Shit Talker v1.2 by Jaundice.</p>
<p>It was created in VMWare Virtual Machine using a special version of Windows XP, called <a href="https://archive.org/details/winlite_202001">MicroXP SP2</a> by a user called eXPerience.</p>
<p>This specific configuration allowed me to bring Shit Talker to you, without very much overhead.</p>
<p>The total size comes in at 79.6MB, using compression.</p>
<p>VMWare is now a free-product, since being purchased by Broadcom.</p>
