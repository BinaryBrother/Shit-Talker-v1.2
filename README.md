<h1>True Apps</h1>
<p>This project contains an old 16-bit program based on VB3/4, called Shit Talker v1.2 by Jaundice.</p>
<p>It was created in VMWare Virtual Machine using a special version of Windows XP, called MicroXP SP2 by a user called EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p>This specific configuration allowed me to bring Shit Talker to you, without very much overhead.</p>
